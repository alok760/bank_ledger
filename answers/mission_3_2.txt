Dear Dr V. Horrible,


On behalf of [bank name], I sincerely apologize for the missing transaction for the wired money of  $10,000 for Startup X in your account and the inconvenience caused by the same.
After careful investigation, we realized that our system experienced a bug and was filtering your wired amount for this transaction due to which it wasn't being reflected in your account for the past week. Startup X closed the deal during this time without your investment as they were unaware of your generous investment.
We deeply regret we failed to deliver the high standard that you’ve come to expect from us. As a token of our apology, we have processed a refund of the entire amount with an additional 7% as inconvenience charges which will reflect in 4-5 business days.
We will share regular updates for the latest rounds of Startup looking funding with you on a regular basis so that you do not miss out on any future opportunities. 
We are taking this incident seriously. Once it was discovered, we took appropriate measures to ensure it would not happen again in the future.  I’m confident your next experience with us will be up to your expectations.
If you would like to discuss the issue further, our customer support team is here for you. Do not hesitate to reach out and let us know how we can make things right. 


Sincerely,
