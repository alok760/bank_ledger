Mockups: HTML+CSS mockups for deposits and withdrawals are included in the web app.

- Where do these flows live?
Deposits and withdraws are an essential part of banking, in the main APP, we should introduce these flows on the home screen.
However, since these flows are used so many times there can be easy access shortcuts from Mobile home screens or long tap-on icon actions.

The Flow of deposits should be
step1. Home Screen -> Deposit/withdraw
step2. Select the payment/ withdraw method
step3. Fill in the details - Select Bank, mode etc
step4. Redirection Screen
step5. Bank Auth
step6. Screen Success

Making this process simple and secure for end-users will have the following steps
- Step2: payment method and step3 bank details can be saved for existing users. 
- More payment options and better integration with 3rd party financial services like PayPal.
- errors and failure notifications.
- MFA for high-value transactions.
- Monthly reminder to change passwords.
- Daily + Weekly automated audits of transaction records from the bank. Automated resolution if possible.
- Proper idempotency for every transaction.
- On mobile app:  comfort features like - OTP auto-read, one-touch transactions, and NFC support can be added for user comfort.
